.SS Mouse commands
.TP
.B Copy and Paste
By default dvtm captures mouse events to provide the actions listed below.
Unfortunately this interferes with the standard X copy and paste mechanism.
To work around this you need to hold down
.B Shift
while selecting or pasting text.
Alternatively you can disable mouse support at compile time, start dvtm with the
.B -M
flag or toggle mouse support during runtime with
.BR Mod\-M .
.TP
.B Button1 click
Select window.
.TP
.B Button1 double click
Select window and toggle maximization.
.TP
.B Button2 click
Zoom/cycle current window to/from master area.
.TP
.B Button3 click
Toggle minimization of current window.
.SS Copy mode
Copy mode gives easy access to past output.
The commands use vi style keybindings and support number prefixes as
command multipliers.
.TP
.B Entering
Copy mode can be entered with
.BR Mod\-v .
.TP
.B Navigation
Once in, navigation works with vi style keybindings
.RB ( h , j , k , l , ^ , $ , g , H , M , L , G )
as well as with the
.BR Arrows / Home / End / Page-Down / Page-Up
keys.
.TP
.B Searching
Search forward with
.B /
and backwards with
.BR ? .
Jump forward to next match with
.BR n .
Jump backwards to next match with
.BR N .
.TP
.B Selecting
To start making a selection press
.B v
(similar to visual mode in vi).
.TP
.B Copying
To copy the current selection use
.BR y .
If you haven't made a selection the current line is copied.
Add a number prefix to copy n lines starting from the current line.
This command leaves the copy mode.
.TP
.B Pasting
The previously copied text can be pasted at the current cursor position
with
.BR Mod\-p .
.TP
.B Leaving
Copy mode is automatically left upon copying something. To manually
exit at any time press
.B ESC
or
.BR q .
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
By default dvtm uses its own terminfo file and therefore sets
.BR TERM=dvtm
within the client windows. This can be overridden by setting the
.BR DVTM_TERM
environment variable to a valid terminal name before launching dvtm.
.SH EXAMPLE
See the
.I dvtm-status
script as an example of how to display text in the
status bar.
.SH CUSTOMIZATION
dvtm is customized by creating a custom
.I config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
