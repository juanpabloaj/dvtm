.SS Mouse commands
.TP
.B Copy and Paste
By default dvtm captures mouse events to provide the actions listed below. Unfortunately
this interferes with the standard X copy and paste mechanism. To work around this
you need to hold down SHIFT while selecting or pasting text. Alternatively you can
disable mouse support at compile time, or use Mod\-M to toggle mouse support dynamically.

.B Button1 click
Select window.

Select window and toggle maximization.
.TP
.B Button2 click
Zooms/cycles current window to/from master area.
.TP

Toggle minimization of current window.

.SS Copy mode
Copy mode gives easy access to past output. The commands use vi style keybindings
and support number prefixes as command multiplier.
.TP
.B Entering
Copy mode can be entered with \fBMod\-v\fR.
.TP
.B Navigation
Once in, navigation works with vi style keybindings (\fBh,j,k,l,^,$,g,H,M,L,G\fR) as well as with the
\fBArrows/Home/End/Page-Down/Page-Up\fR keys.
.TP
.B Searching
Search forward with \fB/\fR and backwards with \fB?\fR. Jump forward to next match with \fBn\fR.
Jump backwards to next match with \fBN\fR.
.TP
.B Selecting
To start making a selection press \fBv\fR (similar to visual mode in vi).
.TP
.B Copying
To copy the current selection use \fBy\fR. If you haven't made a selection the current line is copied.
Add a number prefix to copy n lines starting from the current line. This command leaves the copy mode.
.TP
.B Pasting
The previously copied text can be pasted at the current cursor position with \fBMod\-p\fR.
.TP
.B Leaving
Copy mode is automatically left upon copying something. To manually exit at any
time press \fBESC\fR or \fBq\fR.

.SH EXAMPLE
.TP
See the dvtm-status script as an example of how to display text in the status bar.

.SH CUSTOMIZATION
dvtm is customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the source
code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.
